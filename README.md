# Learn in Public

This repo is a semi-personal, public record of my software development learning journey. It was inspired heavily by [swyx](https://x.com/swyx)'s advice to ["learn in public"](https://gist.github.com/swyxio/9720bd4a30606ca3ffb8d407113c0fe5), which encourages the learner (me) to think deeply about what they are learning, and maybe can help someone on a similar path in the future. I will be focusing on documenting purely for myself for the time beging, as I don't expect anyone else to care, but the point is to produce content publicly, rather than simply consume it privately.

# The Story so Far

I have spent about a year on and off learning programming (almost exclusively Python), data science and machine learning/AI. I used [leetcode](https://leetcode.com)/[neetcode](https://www.youtube.com/@NeetCode) to learn data structures and algorithms (and waste time with fun programming puzzles), [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/seamusbarnes) competitions to learn data science, Jeremy Howard's [fastai](https://course.fast.ai/) and Andrej Karpathy's [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) courses to learn machine learning, and messed around with other courses/projects/content here and there. I also started using Anki after reading Michael Nielsen's amazing essay [Augmenting Long-term Memory](https://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html).

Most of my learning has been sporadic, unfocussed and distracted. When you try to learn a complex topic with lots of interconnected and mutually supporting rabbit holes, my personal experience has been that without a unifying "program" or reference, the content one learns is incredibly leaky. You might spend a few hours here and there over the course of a week on a particular project, but because it's not part of a larger program and hasn't been documented in a unifying log of sorts, it's very easy to forget all about the details. When, on the other hand, you do keep a solid log of what you have done, where and why, in a unified way, you can jump right back into that project and not be immediately blown away. You don't need a formal program like a degree or course, you can create your own program, but it must be singular, unified and well maintained. That's the only way to stay on track and keep yourself accountable (to your past self and your future self, if to no one else).
