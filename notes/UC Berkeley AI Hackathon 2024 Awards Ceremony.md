- LLM OS (a new computer that we are all learning how to program and incorporate into products)
- Two films: Her (2013), I, Robot (2004)
- "Feel the AGI"
  Humans, animals and nature coexisting, with the agi working behind the scenes.

How do we go from hacking to changing the world?
How do projects become real worls change?

_#1 Projects can snowball:_

- rubiks cube colour extractor
- Karpathy put some game programming tutorials on youtube 13 years ago
- neuro evolution simulator

Not all projects go somewhere (they were still helping along the way), but some will

llm101n -> building a chatgpt from scratch to generate stories - OpenAI founding member (8 people and their laptops)

- Very early stage project -> reddit chatbot - Small projects are very fragile but they can go a long way (when the transformer came out this project was spun out to gpt 2, 3, 4, 4o)

_#2 10,000 hours (put in the time, don't worry about exactly what you're doing)_

- The example of spinning up a quick film recommendation website, Karpathy had already done projects like this before several times so it was "easy"

_#3 Keep the dopamine flowing_

- Keep inspired, keep giving your brain rewards
  Great things about projects:
  Your learn very deeply and specifically, so it's a different mode of learning to breadth wise learning (taking courses)
  Put the projects up (this is a jedi-mind trick that increases your motivation to do a good job)

Keep hacking (start hacking)
